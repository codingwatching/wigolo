/**
 * P6 F3 — cross-tab synthesis adapter. Shapes a session's captured artifacts into the `ResearchSource[]`
 * the brief-shaping stage (`buildResearchBrief`) consumes, and keeps an index-aligned provenance array so a
 * brief's `key_finding_sources` indices resolve back to the originating capture (the `fetchedToFull`
 * one-shared-source-array pattern — see memory feedback_research_finding_source_alignment). This file only
 * SHAPES rows: NO network, NO decomposition→search→fetch. Broker-side (real-Node) — the research + embed
 * code lives there; nothing native is pulled into the Electron main.
