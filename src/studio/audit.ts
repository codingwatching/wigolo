/**
 * Phase 6b — the per-session, APPEND-ONLY audit log of every agent action.
 *
 * Records each studio_act the agent attempts together with its resolved outcome, for the
 * two jobs the studio's trust story needs: forensics (what did the agent do, did it
 * succeed or get refused?) and replay (the Phase-7 timeline IS this log, played in order).
 *
 * Append-only by construction: there is no mutate / remove / clear method, every recorded
 * entry is frozen (target + outcome included), and `replay()` hands out a fresh array — so
 * no consumer can rewrite session history. In-memory per session for now; Phase 4 owns the
 * persistent schema/migration.
 *
 * The entry is a CLOSED shape (not an open `[k]: unknown` bag) so this channel carries the
 * same compile-time enforcement the observe channel does.
