/**
 * Per-session queue of human events (navigations now; marks/comments in Phase 3) that
 * `studio_observe` drains for the agent. Delivery is EXACTLY-ONCE via a cursor-ack,
 * the same discipline 2F's base-id gave the diff:
 *
 *  - `drainSince(cursor)` returns events newer than the consumer's last-acked cursor
 *    and trims the acked ones — but it does NOT remove the newer events until the
 *    cursor advances. So if the observe response is lost crossing the stdio↔host
 *    proxy, the next drain at the same cursor REPLAYS them (no silent loss).
 *  - Bounded: on overflow the oldest events drop and the `dropped` count is surfaced
 *    once (fail-loud), so the consumer can force a full resync rather than silently
 *    proceed on a gappy event stream.
